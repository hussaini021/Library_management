# 📚 University Library Management System - Diagram Project


A comprehensive and efficient Library Management System tailored for university-level requirements. This project models the entire lifecycle of library operations — from book registration and transaction tracking to penalties and warehouse management — using an advanced ER diagram.

## 📂 Project Contents

- `library-management-diagram.png` – A detailed diagram representing the structure and workflow of the library management system.
- `library-management-presentation.pptx` – A PowerPoint presentation explaining the diagram and the system components.

## 🧠 About the Diagram

The diagram highlights the core elements of a university library management system:

- **User roles** (students, staff, librarians)
- **Book catalog and database**
- **Borrowing and returning processes**
- **System entities and relationships**
- **Data management and access control**

It provides a clear visual representation suitable for academic analysis, software modeling, and system design documentation.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project was developed as part of an academic assignment to model and present an efficient design for a university's library system using diagrammatic representation.
